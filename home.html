    <p>Virat Kohli against Trent Boult will be one of the key match-ups in the World Test Championship (WTC) final starting Friday (June 18). The Kiwi quick had a good outing against England in the recently concluded second Test which New Zealand won by eight wickets. Boult recorded figures of 4/85 and 2/34 in the Test and will come into the WTC final with renewed confidence for Kane Williamson's side.
         He is bound to come up against Kohli, who will be keen to cement his authority in the upcoming WTC summit clash. Both players have clashed previously in all formats of the game. Ahead of the all-important clash, we take a look at how the two have fared against each other.</p>
